### Summary ###

* In this study, we integrate an existing model of driving (Salvucci, 2006) with a fatigue mechanism (Walsh, Gunzelmann, & Van Dongen, 2014), both implemented in ACT-R cognitive theory and architecture (Anderson, 2007). Then we evaluate the capacity of the integrated model to predict driving performance under moderate levels of fatigue. Based on the previous studies (Forsman et al., 2013; Van Dongen & Belenky, 2010; Van Dongen, Belenky, & Vila, 2011; Van Dongen, Jackson & Belenky 2010), we discuss which metrics or combination of metrics would be the most sensitive to driver drowsiness (moderate levels of fatigue) and how they change based on the time awake. We look at the same metrics in the model and examine fatigue- related effects as compared to behavior in a simple reaction- time task (PVT: Psychomotor Vigilance Test). This research expands on a previous integration (Gunzelmann et al., 2011) by modifying the mechanisms to reflect the current version of the ACT-R theory, and by exploring more detailed performance metrics to assess the modelâ€™s performance.
